Before actually using this package, you need to modify configuration(s) in
/etc/cgit directory. Take a Look at configuration examples and README
to learn more.

To auto-generate a list of available repositories, just run the
following command:

/usr/share/webapps/cgit/cgit-9999/htdocs/cgit.cgi --scan-tree=/your/git/repos

( That's the list of repositories you need to specify in configuration file. )
